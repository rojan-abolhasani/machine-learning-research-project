# GPT-4.0 as Mental Health Advisor

This project was completed as part of the *Project Course in Machine Learning* at the University of TÃ¼bingen (Master's program).

## Overview

This project explores the capabilities of **GPT-4.0** in the role of a **mental health advisor**. The aim is to assess how effectively GPT-4.0 can provide support in emotionally sensitive conversations, and whether it can emulate the strategies used by trained professionals.

## Methods

To evaluate GPT-4.0's performance, we used the **Emotional Support Conversation (ESC)** framework, which outlines a set of strategies typically employed in supportive dialogue, such as:

- Psychodynamic Therapy
- Behavioral Therapy
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- Gestalt Therapy
- and others

We used **BERT** as a classifier to automatically identify which ESC strategies were used in GPT-4.0's responses.

## Expert Consultation

To ensure a meaningful and accurate analysis, we consulted with **real mental health professionals**. Their insights helped validate the strategy classifications and provided deeper interpretation of GPT-4.0's behavior in mental health contexts.

We hope this work contributes to the broader conversation on the safe and ethical use of large language models in sensitive applications like mental health.
